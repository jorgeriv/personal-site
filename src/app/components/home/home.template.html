      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm an experienced web developper, open source enthusiast and tech geek among other things, I was born in the costal city of Manzanillo located in the beautiful state of Colima, Mexico. I graduated as a communications and electronics engineer from the University of Colima and I have been working in web development ever since.

        If I had to describe myself with only one word, I would choose the word "curious" I usually spend many hours a week surfing the web. I have read half the wikipedia just out of curiosity (well, I'm exagerating a bit). I read all kind of books and enjoy watching a good documentary film just about any topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other thins I enjoy beside coding and reading are having a long and interesting chat, drinking a good beer, to cook something I have planted and harvested myself and riding my bicycle into the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the things I dont like are television and facebook. It is not that I don't enjoy the mindless amusement that television has to offer or that I don't get entertained by the endless stream of news, jokes and gossip on facebbok. I do get entertained by them as any other person. But I think of that kind of entertainment as a waste of time.
